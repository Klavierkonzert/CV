This is a jupiter notebook with code for my thesis in which I researched how classical MNIST problem can be solved with almost complete accuracy (more than 99%). 
Since this is not a main output but rather an auxirrary document, many plots are poorly annotated. Also it's in Russian, sorry for that. Hope Google Translate works fine:)
