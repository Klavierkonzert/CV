This is a small project with a pipeline of training and fine-tuning a YOLO model to detect tanks in WOT Blitz game on phones. 2 classes of objects were introduced in this problem (`destroyed_tank` and `tank`), but on the majority of screenshots only one of them is present. Though this could bring some complications, further usage of the model implies focusing on `tank`s rather than `destroyed_tank` + the exact matching of prediction boxes is not cruicial, thus in this problem setting recall must be optimized.

The Jupiter notebook describes the whole pipeline, source data (annotated screenshots) and saved models can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KjH53FHYjSqeUH8SYQ8p0K5VtRbLMM41?usp=drive_link (restricted access)
